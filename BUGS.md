## Bug findings (2024-11-09)

1. **Web app lint script cannot run** – `npm run lint` in `apps/web-app/` immediately fails with “No files matching the pattern `src` were found,” because ESLint is only looking for JS by default and the script never passes TypeScript extensions. Lint coverage for the web client is currently broken. 【be8b24†L1-L5】
2. **Frontend typecheck broken by project references** – `npm run typecheck` in `apps/frontend-app/` terminates with TS6305/TS6310 errors because `tsconfig.json` references `tsconfig.app.json` while both disable emit, so the compiler expects declaration outputs that can’t be produced. No TypeScript check can succeed until the configs are fixed. 【21ca3a†L1-L36】
3. **Frontend lint suite failing with dozens of errors** – `npm run lint` in `apps/frontend-app/` reports 32 errors (missing deps, unused variables, `any` usage, etc.), so the main UI code does not pass linting. Examples include unused `_props` in `components/ui/calendar.tsx` and missing hook deps in `hooks/use-agents.tsx`. 【b30dba†L1-L33】
4. **Frontend auth tests crash in Node** – Running `npx vitest run src/hooks/use-auth.test.tsx` fails because `localStorage` is undefined in the test environment, so the auth hook tests can’t run. The tests need a DOM-like environment or mocks for storage. 【404ae3†L1-L24】
5. **Overly aggressive logout on profile fetch failure** – In `apps/frontend-app/src/hooks/use-auth.tsx`, any failure fetching `/auth/me` triggers `logout()`, clearing tokens even for transient network hiccups. Users get signed out on temporary API issues instead of seeing a recoverable error state. 【F:apps/frontend-app/src/hooks/use-auth.tsx†L80-L108】
