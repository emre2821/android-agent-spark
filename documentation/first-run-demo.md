# First Run Demo

Use this flow to showcase the agent:
1. Start the stack via Docker Compose (`docker-compose up --build`).
2. Open the web UI at http://localhost:3000.
3. Upload or paste a sample `.chaos` payload (see `docs/chaos-format.md`).
4. Submit the request and observe the mocked response in the console/output panel.
5. Iterate with different payloads to highlight agent flexibility.
